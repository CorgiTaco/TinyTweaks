# TinyTweaks
A collection of small tweaks for Minecraft.

## Plant Tweaks
* Easy Harvest Crops - Right clicking fully grown clops harvests and replants them
* Easy Harvest Sugarcane - Right clicking sugarcane harvests all sugarcane higher than the one you clicked. Preserves the bottom-most block
* Sapling Succession - Saplings that fall on dirt or grass will automatically plant
* Grass Spreading - Grass and long grass spread naturally over time. Also removes hitboxes from grass and long grass. Seeds can be obtained by hoeing the ground under them
* Farmer Villager Automation - Farmer villagers will deposit excess items into a nearby chest

## Animal Tweaks
* Animals Eat off the Ground - Chickens, cows, horeses, pigs, sheep, and wolves will eat off the ground
* Wild Wolves Breed - Wild wolves are able to be bred. Allows for some neat natural systems!

## Miscellaneous Tweaks
* Entity Ignition - Right click mobs with flint and steel to light them on fire
* Sturdy Lanterns - Gives lanterns a blast resistance of 6 (allows them to survive Ghast fireballs)
